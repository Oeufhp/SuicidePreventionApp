1. In "api" folder, you can push all files in it to your own server and you don't need to set up Slim. (It's already finished !)
2. In "database-sql" folder, you can import all sql files in your own database and you don't need to spend times for creating new tables.
	import: Select a database you want to import the data in -> "File" -> "Load SQL file" -> Choose sql file -> Click run button above -> finish !!! 
3. Please use your own server, database server. ***Now the url in the project is invalid...
4. Testing the application with a real android device is better than in an emulator.
